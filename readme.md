# :star2: Estimate Multimodal Transformer Observation Difference

:rocket: **Multimodal Transformer Model** | **Image Observation Comparison**

### :fire: Project Overview

Welcome to the **Estimate Multimodal Transformer Observation Difference** project! This project focuses on utilizing a multimodal transformer to generate **observations from two images** and **calculate a numerical difference** between the observations. The images are from the **BDD100K dataset**, and we use **Fuyu-8B model** to compare the observations and generate high-level metrics.

### :dart: **Objective**

Our goal is to:

- Analyze **two images** using the multimodal transformer.
- Generate **numerical difference scores** based on observation disagreements.
- Optionally compute **semantic distance** for more advanced comparisons.
